# Java-Grade11-Chess
A text-based game of Chess made as the final assignment for my Grade 11 programming class. For this assignment, we were supposed to team up with a partner and pick one of three games to program - my partner and I were the only ones who opted to create a game of Chess. Completed over the span of roughly four weeks.
